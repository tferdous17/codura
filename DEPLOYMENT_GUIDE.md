# User Progress System - Deployment Guide

## ✅ System Status: Production Ready

All user progress tracking logic is **technically and logically sound**. You can now proceed with building the code editor and problem-solving features.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Complete Database System

**Files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20250107_complete_user_progress_system.sql` - Main migration
- `USER_PROGRESS_BUSINESS_RULES.md` - Complete business logic documentation
- `USER_PROGRESS_TEST_SCENARIOS.sql` - Comprehensive test scenarios

**Features:**

- ✅ Unique problem solving (no double-counting)
- ✅ Acceptance rate calculation
- ✅ Daily streak logic (consecutive days)
- ✅ Achievements auto-award
- ✅ Contribution grid data
- ✅ All edge cases handled

### 2. Updated Frontend

**Files:**
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Enhanced with month labels, tooltips, achievements
- `app/api/profile/route.ts` - Returns achievements and submission data
- `components/AchievementsList.tsx` - Achievement grid component
- `components/AchievementSummary.tsx` - Compact stats widget

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run the Migration

```bash
cd c:\Users\abdkh\codura

# Option A: Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option B: Manual via Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard
# 2. Copy/paste contents of:
#    supabase/migrations/20250107_complete_user_progress_system.sql
# 3. Click "Run"
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration Success

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name IN ('submissions', 'user_problem_progress', 'user_stats', 'achievements', 'user_achievements')
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Should return all 5 tables

-- Check triggers exist
SELECT trigger_name
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%achievement%' OR trigger_name LIKE '%submission%';

-- Should return 2 triggers

-- Check achievements loaded
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM achievements;

-- Should return 19
```

### Step 3: Test with Sample Data

Replace `YOUR-USER-UUID` with your test user ID, then run:

```sql
-- Create test submissions
SELECT create_test_submission(
  'YOUR-USER-UUID',
  1,
  'Two Sum',
  'Easy',
  'Accepted',
  'JavaScript',
  NOW()
);

-- Verify stats updated
SELECT
  total_solved,
  easy_solved,
  acceptance_rate,
  current_streak
FROM user_stats
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR-USER-UUID';

-- Expected: total_solved=1, easy_solved=1, acceptance_rate=100, current_streak=1

-- Check achievement awarded
SELECT name FROM user_achievements_with_details
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR-USER-UUID';

-- Expected: "First Steps"
```

### Step 4: Clean Up Test Data

```sql
-- After testing, clean up
DELETE FROM user_achievements WHERE user_id = 'YOUR-USER-UUID';
DELETE FROM submissions WHERE user_id = 'YOUR-USER-UUID';
DELETE FROM user_problem_progress WHERE user_id = 'YOUR-USER-UUID';
UPDATE user_stats SET
  total_solved = 0,
  easy_solved = 0,
  medium_solved = 0,
  hard_solved = 0,
  current_streak = 0,
  longest_streak = 0,
  acceptance_rate = 0,
  last_submission_date = NULL
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR-USER-UUID';
```

### Step 5: Start Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/profile` to see the enhanced profile page with:
- Contribution grid with month labels and tooltips
- Achievements section
- Recent submissions
- Stats cards

## How to Use in Your Code Editor

When building the code editor, here's how to integrate with this system:

### When User Submits Code:

```typescript
// app/api/submit-code/route.ts (or wherever you handle submissions)

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const supabase = await createClient();
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

  const { problemId, code, language } = await request.json();

  // 1. Run the code (your code execution logic here)
  const result = await executeCode(code, language, testCases);

  // 2. Determine status
  const status = result.allTestsPassed ? 'Accepted' : 'Wrong Answer';

  // 3. Insert submission (THIS IS ALL YOU NEED TO DO!)
  const { data: submission, error } = await supabase
    .from('submissions')
    .insert({
      user_id: user.id,
      problem_id: problemId,
      problem_title: 'Two Sum', // Get from problem data
      difficulty: 'Easy',        // Get from problem data
      status: status,
      language: language,
      runtime_ms: result.runtime,
      memory_kb: result.memory,
      submitted_at: new Date().toISOString()
    })
    .select()
    .single();

  // 4. Everything else happens automatically via triggers:
  //    - user_stats updated
  //    - user_problem_progress updated
  //    - Acceptance rate recalculated
  //    - Streak updated (if first solve of the day)
  //    - Achievements awarded (if milestones reached)

  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    status: status,
    submission: submission
  });
}
```

That's it! Just insert into `submissions` table and everything else is automatic.

## Business Rules Summary

### Submissions
- Every code attempt creates a submission record
- Can retry same problem unlimited times
- All attempts (accepted + failed) show in contribution grid

### Problems Solved
- `total_solved` only increments on FIRST accepted submission per problem
- Re-solving same problem doesn't increment counters
- Difficulty counters (easy/medium/hard) work the same way

### Acceptance Rate
- Formula: (Accepted Submissions / Total Submissions) × 100
- Includes ALL submissions (even re-solves)
- Updates automatically on every submission

### Daily Streak
- Increments when solving at least 1 NEW problem on consecutive days
- Resets to 1 if you skip a day
- Re-solving old problems doesn't count toward streak
- Multiple solves in one day count as 1 day

### Contribution Grid
- Shows ALL submissions (accepted + failed + re-solves)
- Color intensity based on submission count per day
- Month labels and hover tooltips included

### Achievements
- Auto-awarded when reaching milestones
- Based on `user_stats` values
- One-time only (can't earn twice)

## Data Integrity Checks

Run these periodically to ensure data consistency:

```sql
-- Check 1: total_solved matches progress table
SELECT
  u.user_id,
  u.full_name,
  (SELECT total_solved FROM user_stats WHERE user_id = u.user_id) as stats_total,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_problem_progress WHERE user_id = u.user_id AND first_solved_at IS NOT NULL) as progress_total,
  CASE
    WHEN (SELECT total_solved FROM user_stats WHERE user_id = u.user_id) =
         (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_problem_progress WHERE user_id = u.user_id AND first_solved_at IS NOT NULL)
    THEN '✓ OK'
    ELSE '✗ MISMATCH'
  END as status
FROM users u
LIMIT 10;

-- Check 2: Acceptance rate is correct
SELECT
  user_id,
  (SELECT acceptance_rate FROM user_stats WHERE user_id = s.user_id) as stored_rate,
  ROUND(
    (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'Accepted')::NUMERIC / COUNT(*)::NUMERIC) * 100,
    1
  ) as calculated_rate
FROM submissions s
GROUP BY user_id
LIMIT 10;

-- Check 3: Difficulty sum equals total
SELECT
  user_id,
  total_solved,
  easy_solved + medium_solved + hard_solved as difficulty_sum,
  CASE
    WHEN total_solved = (easy_solved + medium_solved + hard_solved)
    THEN '✓ OK'
    ELSE '✗ MISMATCH'
  END as status
FROM user_stats
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Stats not updating after submission

**Check trigger exists:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger
WHERE tgname = 'trigger_update_stats_from_submission';
```

**Manually trigger update:**
```sql
SELECT backfill_user_progress('user-uuid');
```

### Issue: Streak not incrementing

**Check if submission was accepted:**
```sql
SELECT problem_id, status, first_solved_at
FROM user_problem_progress
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'
ORDER BY last_attempted_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Streak only increments on NEW solves (where `first_solved_at` gets set for the first time).

### Issue: Achievement not awarded

**Check stats vs requirements:**
```sql
-- See user stats
SELECT * FROM user_stats WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid';

-- See achievement requirements
SELECT * FROM achievements ORDER BY requirement_type, requirement_value;

-- Manually backfill
SELECT backfill_achievements_for_user('user-uuid');
```

## Performance Optimization

The system is already optimized with:

- ✅ Indexes on frequently queried columns
- ✅ Efficient trigger logic (only fires when needed)
- ✅ Pre-computed stats (no expensive joins at runtime)
- ✅ Optimized views for common queries

No additional optimization needed for MVP.

---

## Next Steps

You're now ready to build:

1. **Code Editor Page** - Monaco/CodeMirror with language support
2. **Test Case Runner** - Execute code against test cases
3. **Problem Display** - Show problem description, constraints, examples
4. **Submission Handler** - Just insert into `submissions` table (that's it!)

The entire progress tracking system is automated and production-ready.

## Quick Reference

### Create a submission:
```sql
INSERT INTO submissions (user_id, problem_id, problem_title, difficulty, status, language)
VALUES ('user-uuid', 1, 'Two Sum', 'Easy', 'Accepted', 'JavaScript');
```

### Check user stats:
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_stats WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid';
```

### See user achievements:
```sql
SELECT name, description, earned_at
FROM user_achievements_with_details
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'
ORDER BY earned_at DESC;
```

### View problem progress:
```sql
SELECT problem_id, difficulty, total_attempts, accepted_attempts, first_solved_at
FROM user_problem_progress
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'
ORDER BY last_attempted_at DESC;
```
