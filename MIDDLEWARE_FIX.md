# Middleware Fix - Public Profile Access

## Issue
Users were being forced to login when viewing profiles in incognito mode or when not logged in.

## Root Cause
The middleware was protecting ALL routes except those explicitly listed in `PUBLIC_PATHS`. Since `/profile/[username]` routes are dynamic, they weren't included and were being blocked.

## Solution
Updated `middleware.ts` to allow public access to:

1. **Profile routes** - `/profile/[username]` - Anyone can view user profiles
2. **Problems page** - `/problems` - Anyone can browse problems

## Changes Made

### Before:
```typescript
const isPublic = PUBLIC_PATHS.has(pathname);
const isAuthRoute = pathname.startsWith("/auth");

if (!user && !isPublic && !isAuthRoute) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/login", origin));
}
```

### After:
```typescript
const isPublic = PUBLIC_PATHS.has(pathname);
const isAuthRoute = pathname.startsWith("/auth");
const isPublicProfile = pathname.startsWith("/profile/"); // ✅ NEW
const isProblemsPage = pathname.startsWith("/problems");   // ✅ NEW

if (!user && !isPublic && !isAuthRoute && !isPublicProfile && !isProblemsPage) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/login", origin));
}
```

## Testing

### ✅ Test in Incognito/Private Window:
1. Open incognito window
2. Navigate to `https://yoursite.com/profile/username`
3. Profile should load WITHOUT login redirect
4. Should see:
   - Full profile header
   - Stats and contribution graph
   - Privacy badge (if private)
   - Blur overlays on private content (if applicable)

### ✅ Test Problems Page:
1. Open incognito window
2. Navigate to `/problems`
3. Should be able to browse problems without login

### ✅ Test Other Routes:
1. Try accessing `/dashboard` in incognito
2. Should redirect to `/login` (protected route)
3. Try accessing `/settings` in incognito
4. Should redirect to `/login` (protected route)
