# ‚úÖ Profile Page Setup Complete!

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Supabase)
Created comprehensive tables in [supabase/migrations/001_create_user_profiles.sql](supabase/migrations/001_create_user_profiles.sql):

- **user_profiles** - Stores user information (username, bio, links, university, etc.)
- **user_stats** - Tracks problem-solving statistics
- **submissions** - Records all user problem submissions
- **achievements** - Predefined achievement definitions
- **user_achievements** - Tracks which users earned which achievements

**Row Level Security (RLS)** is enabled with proper policies:
- Users can view all profiles (public)
- Users can only edit their own profile
- Users can only see their own submissions

### 2. API Routes
Created [app/api/profile/route.ts](app/api/profile/route.ts):

- **GET** `/api/profile` - Fetches user profile, stats, submissions, and achievements
- **PUT** `/api/profile` - Updates user profile with validation

### 3. Edit Profile Dialog
Created [components/edit-profile-dialog.tsx](components/edit-profile-dialog.tsx):

A beautiful, sleek modal form with:
- **Basic Info**: Username, Full Name, Bio
- **Education & Work**: University, Graduation Year, Job Title, Location
- **Links**: Website, GitHub username, LinkedIn username
- Real-time validation using Zod
- Error handling and loading states

### 4. Dynamic Profile Page
Updated [app/profile/page.tsx](app/profile/page.tsx):

- ‚úÖ No more hardcoded data!
- ‚úÖ Fetches real data from Supabase
- ‚úÖ Loading states
- ‚úÖ Edit Profile button
- ‚úÖ GitHub-style contribution grid (uses real submission data)
- ‚úÖ Problem-solving stats
- ‚úÖ Recent submissions
- ‚úÖ Achievements system

### 5. Sign Out Functionality
Fixed [app/dashboard/page.tsx](app/dashboard/page.tsx) and [app/auth/signout/route.ts](app/auth/signout/route.ts):

- ‚úÖ Sign Out button now properly signs out the user
- ‚úÖ Redirects to landing page (/) after sign out
- ‚úÖ Clears all authentication cookies

3. Populate your `/problems` page with real data
4. Allow users to:
   - View problems
   - Filter by difficulty/tags
   - Submit solutions
   - Track their progress

When users solve problems:
- Their stats will automatically update
- Submissions will be recorded
- The contribution grid will show real activity
- Achievements will be earned

**Ready to start on LeetCode scraping?** Let me know!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" error on profile page
- Make sure you're signed in
- Check that the database migration ran successfully
- Verify RLS policies are enabled

### Profile not updating
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the API route at `/api/profile` is working
- Make sure your `.env` has the correct Supabase credentials

### "Failed to fetch profile data"
