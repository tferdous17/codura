# Hardcoded Data Removal & Username Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Removed ALL Hardcoded User Data from Dashboard**

Previously hardcoded data that's now dynamic:

#### ❌ Before (Hardcoded):
```typescript
const recentActivity = [
  { id: 1, type: "problem", title: "Two Sum", difficulty: "Easy", time: "2 hours ago" },
  // ... fake data
];

const upcomingEvents = [
  { id: 1, type: "mock", title: "Mock Interview", date: "Oct 7", time: "2:00 PM" },
  // ... fake data
];

const dailyChallenge = {
  title: "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters",
  difficulty: "Medium",
  topics: ["Hash Table", "String", "Sliding Window"]
};
```

#### ✅ After (Dynamic):
All data now fetched from APIs based on **actual user activity**:
- Recent Activity from submissions & calendar events
- Upcoming Events from calendar events
- Daily Challenge from problems table (personalized)

### 2. **Username Required During Signup**

**New Signup Flow:**
1. User enters: Full Name, **Username**, Email, Password
2. Username is validated (3-20 chars, alphanumeric + _ -)
3. Username uniqueness is checked
4. Username stored in `user_profiles` table
5. All user data properly linked via username

**Files Modified:**
- [components/signup-form.tsx](components/signup-form.tsx) - Added username field
- [app/login/actions.ts](app/login/actions.ts) - Added username validation & storage

## 📁 New API Endpoints Created

### 1. Recent Activity API
**Endpoint:** `/api/dashboard/recent-activity`

**What it does:**
- Fetches user's recent problem submissions (Accepted status)
- Fetches user's completed calendar events (interviews, study pods)
- Combines and sorts by timestamp
- Returns formatted activity with time ago (e.g., "2 hours ago")

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "activity": [
    {
      "id": "sub-123",
      "type": "problem",
      "title": "Two Sum",
      "difficulty": "Easy",
      "time": "2 hours ago"
    },
    {
      "id": "event-456",
      "type": "interview",
      "title": "Mock Interview with John",
      "time": "1 day ago"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Upcoming Events API
**Endpoint:** `/api/dashboard/upcoming-events`

**What it does:**
- Fetches user's future calendar events (incomplete only)
- Sorts by date and time (earliest first)
- Formats dates (e.g., "Jan 15") and times (e.g., "2:00 PM")

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "abc123",
      "type": "mock",
      "title": "Mock Interview",
      "date": "Jan 15",
      "time": "2:00 PM"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Daily Challenge API
**Endpoint:** `/api/dashboard/daily-challenge`

**What it does:**
- Fetches a Medium difficulty problem
- Excludes problems user has already solved
- Picks deterministically based on day of year (same for all users on same day)
- Returns problem with topics and slug for linking

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "challenge": {
    "title": "Container With Most Water",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "topics": ["Array", "Two Pointers"],
    "slug": "container-with-most-water"
  }
}
```

## 🆕 Username Implementation

### Signup Form Changes

**New Field Added:**
```tsx
<div className="grid gap-3">
  <Label htmlFor="username">Username</Label>
  <Input
    name="username"
    type="text"
    placeholder="johndoe"
    pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{3,20}"
    title="Username must be 3-20 characters..."
    required
  />
  <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
    3-20 characters, letters, numbers, - and _ only
  </p>
</div>
```

### Validation Rules
- **Length:** 3-20 characters
- **Characters:** Letters, numbers, underscore (_), hyphen (-)
- **Uniqueness:** Checked against existing usernames
- **Case:** Stored as lowercase for consistency

### Backend Implementation

**In `app/login/actions.ts`:**

1. **Extract username from form:**
```typescript
const username = formData.get('username') as string
```

2. **Validate format:**
```typescript
const usernameRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{3,20}$/
if (!usernameRegex.test(username)) {
  redirect('/error')
}
```

3. **Check uniqueness:**
```typescript
const { data: existingUser } = await supabase
  .from('user_profiles')
  .select('username')
  .eq('username', username.toLowerCase())
  .single()

if (existingUser) {
  redirect('/error') // Username taken
}
```

4. **Save to auth metadata:**
```typescript
const data = {
  email,
  password,
  options: {
    data: {
      full_name: fullName,
      username: username.toLowerCase(),
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Create profile with username:**
```typescript
await supabase
  .from('user_profiles')
  .insert({
    id: user.id,
    full_name: fullName,
    username: username.toLowerCase(),
  })
```

## 🔒 Data Flow

### User Signup Flow
```
1. User fills signup form (name, username, email, password)
   ↓
2. Frontend validates username format (pattern attribute)
   ↓
3. Backend validates username format (regex)
   ↓
4. Backend checks username uniqueness (database query)
   ↓
5. User created in auth.users with metadata
   ↓
6. Profile created in user_profiles with username
   ↓
7. User redirected to onboarding/dashboard
```

### Dashboard Data Flow
```
User logs in
   ↓
Dashboard loads
   ↓
Fetches in parallel:
   ├─ User profile (name, stats, etc.)
   ├─ Study plans (from user_problem_lists)
   ├─ Recent activity (from submissions + events)
   ├─ Upcoming events (from calendar_events)
   └─ Daily challenge (from problems)
   ↓
All data displayed dynamically
```
